Introduction: 
What is a recommender system?
A recommender system is a filtration program whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you.  The domain-specific item is a movie; therefore, the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
